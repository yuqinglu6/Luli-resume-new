    <p>An IKEA Object State Dataset is created, which is a 6DoF object pose estimation dataset and benchmark for multi-state assembly
        objects. The annotations are semi-automated. The initial guess of the object's pose is provided by picking at least three
        corresponding points manually, then the ICP algorithm is used for refinement. The result of the current frame will be used as the
        initial pose of the next frame to avoid manually annotating all the frames.</p>

    <p>03/2023 - 11/2023 Kaiserslautern, Germany</p>
    <p>Zebrapose3d is proposed based on the existing Zebrapose and extends the idea into 3D to construct a coarse to fine 3D-3D
        mapping for 6DoF object pose estimation. Deep learning is applied to help with obtaining correspondence represented by unique
        16-bit binary codes. Then 6DoF pose estimation of objects is achieved through point cloud registration.
        SketchNet is implemented for 6DoF object tracking using a CNN to compute the current frame's signed distance field (SDF) image, a
        visibility mask, and nine vector images containing information about predefined keypoints. Iteration is applied during the training,
        which means that visibility masks will be fed back to the network a few times. The pose is then obtained by optimization based on
        the predicted information.</p>
    <li>STUDENT RESEARCHER in GERMAN RESEARCH CENTRE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (DFKI)</li>
    <p>04/2021 - 09/2021 Kaiserslautern, Germany</p>
    <p>SDFNet is proposed to combine the feature-based traditional method with CNN to realize the 6DOF object tracking. CNN is used to
        predict the SDF image and the visible mask. Based on the predicted values, the pose can be optimized using the Gaussian-Newton
        method.</p>
    <li>STUDENT RESEARCHER in GERMAN RESEARCH CENTRE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (DFKI)</li>
    <p>10/2020 - 03/2021 Kaiserslautern, Germany</p>
    <p>Research on the existing methods of shape modeling based on patch priors with deep learning. Learned that patch priors capture
        patch-wise similar properties, allowing for better generalization across categories than global priors, especially implicit methods
        with more continuity and feasibility.</p>
