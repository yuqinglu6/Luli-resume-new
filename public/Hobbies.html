        </ul>
    <li><h2>Traveling</h2></li>
    <p>Every year on my birthday, I make it a point to visit a new place, explore unseen landscapes, and try activities I haven't done before, keeping my appreciation for the world's diversity alive. Whenever I have the chance during important holidays or anniversaries, I also embark on trips to experience a different environment, relishing moments that break away from my daily routine. These adventures serve as wonderful refreshers in my life.</p>
    <li><h2>Listening to music</h2></li>
    <p>During my school years, my favorite artist was JJ Lin. His songs provided me with strength and resonated deeply with me at that time. I don’t have a specific favorite genre; I choose songs based on how I feel, often switching it up according to my mood. I love going to live music venues to celebrate with others, and I also enjoy cranking up the volume at home to immerse myself in my own world. There's something special about sharing earbuds with friends in a crowd, listening to a song that belongs just to us. Music is magical—gentle yet powerful, mysterious yet authentic; it’s a beautiful expression of the surreal and romantic.</p>
    <li><h2>Other Hobbies</h2></li>
    <p>I still have many hobbies that I've tried and really enjoyed, but I haven't yet had the opportunity to dive deeper into them. It would be more appropriate to describe them as interests. They are all on my wish list, waiting for the chance to become a more significant part of my life.</p>
